                In the beginning, our activities were focused on Greater Bamboo Lemur (Prolemur simus), a giant bamboo specialist, classified by <span className="underline underline-offset-4 decoration-yellow-700 hover:text-yellow-700"> #IUCN</span> as Critically Endangered (CR) since 2008. 
                With the observed evolution of threats, evolution of lemur conservation status, and with the help of different supporters, we have extended our focal species and have included 5 more critically endangered (IUCN Classification - CR) species, namely, 
                the Black-and-White Ruffed Lemur (Varecia variegata), the Indri (Indri Indro), the Diademed Sifaka (Propithecus diadema), the Crowned Sifaka (Propithecus coronatus) and the Mongoose Lemur (Eulemur mongoz). 
                Since 2016, we have extended our activities and took into consideration other taza like birds, bats, cichlids and reptiles.

                Our activities are three folded: Research, Education, and Conservation. We are running a year round data collection on lemur, its habitat and threats all over our site. These data collection are conducted in collaboration with local communities.
                We count <span className="underline underline-offset-4 decoration-yellow-700 text-yellow-700 text-xl"> 25 teams </span>of 2 to 3 Rangers, carrying a regular data collection under the supervision of our  technicians. We are orienting our education and information sharing based on what we observed in field. 
                Data collected are also analyzed and used to orient our strategies for conservation.
